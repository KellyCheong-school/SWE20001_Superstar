        <li>
            Amed Beach<br>
            The main beach at Amed, on the far northeastern tip of Bali, has a mix of fine black sand (from the volcano) and smooth rocks.
            It’s a quiet beach lined with fishing boats and small hotels, and the sunsets over the volcano every night are awe inspiring.

        <li>
            Jemeluk Beach<br>
            This scenic bay is the main snorkeling site in Amed, with good corals on both sides of the bay.
            There’s also a popular viewpoint near the road where you can watch the sunset over the bay.
            Jemeluk has lots of good restaurant and hotel options, and you can walk here from Amed Beach in about 10 minutes.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Yeh Leh Beach<br>
            This is one of the best sunset beaches in Bali, but it’s not very well known since it’s hiding in West Bali.
            The coast at Yeh Leh Beach is covered with smooth boulders and tide pools, so it’s great for sunset photos.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Balian Beach<br>
            This is a quiet beach west of Canggu that’s becoming a popular surfing spot, and it has plenty of accommodation and restaurants nearby.
            Balian is a volcanic ash beach, with soft black sand and great sunsets!
            It’s a 1 to 1.5 hour drive from Canggu or Ubud.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Kuta Beach<br>
            This is Bali’s original beach! It’s a classic, so I had to mention it.
            You won’t find peace and quiet here, but it’s still worth a visit. 
            Shop at the Beachwalk Mall, go surfing, or watch the sunset with a Bintang.
